# QRS_Detection_App
Matlab application, which finds QRS peaks and based on that calculates heart rate.

QRS is the main spike seen on an ECG line.  Q wave is any downward deflection after the P wave.  Next, we can see the R wave peak which is an upward deflection. The S wave is any downward deflection after the R wave.In medicine, heart rate is the number of times the heart beats within a certain time period, usually a minute. The resting heart rate is normally between 60 and 100 beats a minute in a healthy adult. It can be also called pulse.

  Below you can see the screenshot of an application, it was made in Matlab, the applicaiton itself uses wavelet transforms. The top graph shows ECG signal, while the bottom graph shows found R peaks. In the top right corner we can see the heart rate calculated using that ECG recording.
